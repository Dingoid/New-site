WHAT I DID TODAY:  


WHERE I LEFT OFF:


CODING GAME NEEDS: (not sorted)
    For loop?
        (maybe i come back to the idea to introduce a for loop to cut down on actions, but need to style one first)
        (i have no idea how i even want it to look which is problem #1)
        
    Scoring system
        (timer i think would work better than minimum actions because of the randomly generated maps)
        (or i could do a "how close to perfect were you" id have to make a system to count actions including turns tho)
            (i think i like the "close to perfect" more than time)
            (then after the 3 levels it tells you like how close to overall perfect you were)
            (for loops would also let you move below the minimum moves which would make it like golf scoring)
