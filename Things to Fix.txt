OVERALL THINGS TO LEARN/FIX:

    game scaling, maintain aspect ratio when shrunk and general css shit, scaling is kinda fucked on everything

    scroll buttons that get bigger based on what part of the page youre on and you can click on them to quickly scroll to that part of the page
        (the balls are there but the do literally nothing right now)

    fix general cs shit

    basic CRUD app add to website

    put contact info and stuff on either top or bottom of projects


WHAT I DID TODAY: 
    fixed collision
    
    return player to initial spawn when they touch spike

    set numOfSpikes to a static 100

    fixed movement and collision bug

    lives and levels implemented

    clear, delete, and go can no longer be spammed and break the game

    only one set of actions per level implemented


WHERE I LEFT OFF:
    line(452)
        found potential problem with the delete and clear where if you're over 33 button presses it will only delete or clear the left panel (easy fix but brain broken rn)

        also having the panels set to 33 inputs each will cause problems with css scaling later but that can be fixed later
    

CODING GAME NEEDS: (not sorted)

    For loop?
        (maybe i come back to the idea to introduce a for loop to cut down on actions, but need to style one first)
        (i have no idea how i even want it to look which is problem #1)

    Clean JS 
        (there are a lot of functions written inside of other functions instead of just called in them, should take them out and just call them instead)
        (also move all the variables to the top)
        (specifically the gameStart function)

    Start screen
        (start button on a background that starts the game and makes everything visible)
        (then when player loses, takes them back to that screen)

    Sprites
        (probably just rip shit off google or whatever, just somethin better than boxes)
        (maybe even change background, idk i kinda like minecraft grass)
        
    Scoring system
        (timer i think would work better than minimum actions because of the randomly generated maps)
        (or i could do a "how close to perfect were you" id have to make a system to count actions including turns tho)
            (i think i like the "close to perfect" more than time)
            (then after the 3 levels it tells you like how close to overall perfect you were)
            (for loops would also let you move below the minimum moves which would make it like golf scoring)
