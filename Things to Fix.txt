THINGS TO LEARN/FIX OVERALL:

    game scaling, maintain aspect ratio when shrunk and general css shit, scaling is kinda fucked on everything

    scroll buttons that get bigger based on what part of the page youre on and you can click on them to quickly scroll to that part of the page
        (the balls are there but the do literally nothing right now)

    fix general cs shit


WHERE I LEFT OFF:
    line(701)
        want to add a loop function, also when buttons are clicked and added, if they reach the bottom
        they just start pushing everything (pretty sure its a css thing)
        idk its just kinda fucked but ill figure it out
    

    after that i need to make the movement system actually work
        (press movement buttons to add actions to queue then on "Go" button press, it does all the moves, or "clear" to clear all actions selected)

    make a lives system
        (player has like 3 lives or somethin, when player runs into spike, loose life and restart puzzle, keep same spikes and goal but just reset player)

    make a levels system
        (you only beat the game after you clear idk 3 levels or somethin)

    add scoring system
        (timer i think would work better than minimum actions because of the randomly generated maps)
        (or i could do a "how close to perfect were you" id have to make a system to count actions including turns tho)
            (i think i like the "close to perfect" more than time)

    add "sprites"
        (probably just rip shit off google or whatever, just somethin better than boxes)
        (maybe even change background, idk i kinda like minecraft grass)
    

CODING GAME NEEDS: (not sorted)

    goal colision detection
        (if player runs into goal, move to next level and generate new layout)
        (!! HALF DONE !!) (it throws a console.log but it doesnt like actually do anything but its hooked up)

    player movement
        (start with buttons to move, then make player actions get stored until go button is pressed)
        (!! HALF DONE !!) (player moves on button press and turns but the whole "store actions until go" thing isnt yet)
        (this will probably be last cause it makes testing harder)
    
    Clean JS 
        (there are a lot of functions written inside of other functions instead of just called in them, should take them out and just call them instead)
        (also move all the variables to the top)
        (specifically the gameStart function)

    timer
        (from start of first level to end of last level, then post time to screen)
        (dont know if i want this or like "how many actions did it take you" and i introduce like rudimentary for loop thing)

    lives
        (if player hits spike and loses life, remove life, if lives = -1, game over and full reset)

    Num of Spikes on button
        (did work previously, but got rid of buttons and its now hard coded)
        (will probably be worded as like "easy, medium, hard" because the num of spikes changes so much based on spawns)

    start button ----- (*DONE* kinda, its the move player/goal button rn, still needs to be CSS'd)
        (start button that spawns everything and makes background visible)
