OVERALL THINGS TO LEARN/FIX:

    game scaling, maintain aspect ratio when shrunk and general css shit, scaling is kinda fucked on everything

    scroll buttons that get bigger based on what part of the page youre on and you can click on them to quickly scroll to that part of the page
        (the balls are there but the do literally nothing right now)

    fix general cs shit

    basic CRUD app add to website

    put contact info and stuff on either top or bottom of projects


WHAT I DID TODAY:
    moved js into seperate files

IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS (sorted): 
    if player selects over 33 actions, movement breaks cause it doesnt remove them from right side

    goal detection is fucked
        (idk what i did)

    if player spams forward movements on borders, they can break the grid on all sides

    also having the panels set to 33 inputs each will cause problems with css scaling later but that can be fixed later

    gameMovement has a lot of things in it that could be somewhere else
        (like their own functions or whatever)
        (like a "collision detection" function that runs before movement instead of the millions of checks inside movement)


WHERE I LEFT OFF:
    if player has moves stored while they touch the goal, theyll instead go through the goal
        this probably happens because it does movement and then checks if player in ontop of goal
            (doesnt happen to spikes which probably means i can take that code)


CODING GAME NEEDS: (not sorted)
    For loop?
        (maybe i come back to the idea to introduce a for loop to cut down on actions, but need to style one first)
        (i have no idea how i even want it to look which is problem #1)

    Sprites
        (probably just rip shit off google or whatever, just somethin better than boxes)
        (maybe even change background, idk i kinda like minecraft grass)
        
    Scoring system
        (timer i think would work better than minimum actions because of the randomly generated maps)
        (or i could do a "how close to perfect were you" id have to make a system to count actions including turns tho)
            (i think i like the "close to perfect" more than time)
            (then after the 3 levels it tells you like how close to overall perfect you were)
            (for loops would also let you move below the minimum moves which would make it like golf scoring)
